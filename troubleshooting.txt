PROBLEM
=======
Running pd_front_end.py with FSPS installed through pip returns an import error.

CAUSE
=====
Git has not been loaded as a module on the supercomputer node.

TRACEBACK
=========
File "/home/cmcclellan1010/anaconda2/envs/pdenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/fsps/__init__.py", line 38, in <module>
    raise ImportError("Your FSPS version does not seem to be under git version "
ImportError: Your FSPS version does not seem to be under git version control. FSPS is available on github at https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps and should be cloned from there

SOLUTION
========
Use "ml git"



PROBLEM
=======
Metallicities for stars in the galaxy simulation are outside of the range that fsps can handle.

CAUSE
=====


TRACEBACK
=========
assigning stars to SED bins
Running SPS for Binned SEDs
calculating the SEDs for  1204  bins
delta_chunk_indices =  75
Entering Pool.map multiprocessing for Stellar SED generation
 SSP_GEN ERROR: metallicity outside of range          14

 SSP_GEN ERROR: metallicity outside of range          21
 SSP_GEN ERROR: metallicity outside of range          13

SOLUTION
========
Floor or ceiling these out-of-bounds metallicities with the maximum allowable
or minimum allowable metallicity in fsps.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============
Will change the code to perform the floor/ceiling operation.



PROBLEM
=======
Can't find hyperion / other module when running pd_front_end.py on a cluster node.

CAUSE
=====
The vanilla anaconda path environment variable is prepended and overrides the python environment in which the module is installed. 

TRACEBACK
=========

SOLUTION
========
Move anaconda python path environment variable to end of .bashrc.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============
